# Welcome to the Fluid Examples Repository!
This codebase includes examples of collaborative applications built with Fluid. For Fluid Framework documentation, go to [FluidFramework.com](www.FluidFramework.com). The Fluid Framework repository lives at [Github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework](Github.com/Microsoft/FluidFramework).

Each example is a standalone application that defines a Fluid Container and loads it into a webpage.
